According to an online source, both Data Science and Statistics are 
careers/professions that utilizes the concepts of mathematics, technology, 
business, computer programming, data, and communication, along with data, to 
tackle real-world problems.

However, there are some differences between a "Data Scientist" and a "Statisti
cian". According to a source called "Masters in Data Science", it explicilty 
states that data science involves the "collection/gathering, organization, 
analysis, and visualization of the data". While, statisticians formulate or 
create "mathematical models" to describe relationships between outcomes, and
predict based on the relationships.

I am satisfied with having careers in both areas & disciplines.
